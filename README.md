Apolokak Lab Theme for phpMyAdmin 4.7.x

_**Update**: 19/01/2018

---
This theme was born simply out of my deepest needs - more precisely the need to not have to stare at the ugly default phpMyAdmin theme all day long (sorry, *guy* who made it). But seriously now, it had to come to this - in a multiple screen setup where Gnome looks awesome, terminal windows look awesome and Sublime Text tops everything, phpMyAdmin just didn't belong.

I guess one could say PMA8165 was somewhat inspired from the [Numix GTK3 theme](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-GTK3-theme-360223962) which, in combination with a few more things, can make Gnome look lethal as detailed in one of my fascinating blog posts on [How To: Make Linux Look Sexy In Only 3 Fast Steps](http://howto8165.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/linux-minimalist-desktop/).
